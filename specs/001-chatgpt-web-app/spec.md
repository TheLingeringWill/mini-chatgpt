# Feature Specification: Minimal ChatGPT Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-chatgpt-web-app`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Build a minimal ChatGPT-style web app with a basic chat UI (send, cancel, disable input while waiting, no streaming), a left sidebar for conversations (create, delete, numbered titles, continuous history), and robust handling for mock backend LLM calls (retry on 500s, timeout after 12s, abort on cancel with friendly error feedback).

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Single Conversation Chat (Priority: P1)

Users can have a basic back-and-forth conversation with the LLM in a single chat session, sending messages and receiving responses without any advanced features.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality - without the ability to send and receive messages, there is no chat application. This delivers immediate value and can be independently tested and demonstrated.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the app, typing a message, sending it, and receiving a response. No conversation management needed - just one active conversation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is open with an empty conversation, **When** the user types "Hello" and clicks send, **Then** the message appears in the chat, input is disabled, and a response from the LLM appears within 12 seconds
2. **Given** the user has sent a message and is waiting for a response, **When** the LLM takes longer than 12 seconds, **Then** a timeout error message appears and the input is re-enabled
3. **Given** the user has sent a message and is waiting for a response, **When** the user clicks the cancel button, **Then** the request is aborted, a cancellation message appears, and the input is re-enabled
4. **Given** the backend returns a 500 error, **When** the retry logic executes, **Then** the system retries the request and either succeeds or shows an error after multiple attempts
5. **Given** the user receives a response, **When** the user sends another message, **Then** the conversation continues with full history visible

### User Story 2 - Conversation Management (Priority: P2)

Users can create multiple conversations, switch between them, and delete conversations they no longer need, with each conversation maintaining its own independent chat history.

**Why this priority**: This enables users to organize different topics or sessions, significantly improving usability for ongoing use. However, it's not required for the core chat functionality to work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating 2-3 new conversations, sending messages in each, switching between them to verify history persistence, and deleting one conversation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is open, **When** the user clicks "New Conversation", **Then** a new numbered conversation appears in the sidebar and becomes active with an empty chat area
2. **Given** multiple conversations exist in the sidebar, **When** the user clicks on a different conversation, **Then** that conversation's full history loads and displays
3. **Given** a conversation is selected in the sidebar, **When** the user clicks the delete button for that conversation, **Then** the conversation is removed from the sidebar and the user is redirected to another conversation or a new empty one
4. **Given** the user creates conversation #3, **When** they return after a page refresh, **Then** all conversations and their histories are preserved

---

### User Story 3 - Robust Error Recovery (Priority: P3)

Users receive clear, actionable feedback when things go wrong (network issues, backend errors, timeouts) and can easily recover to continue their work.

**Why this priority**: This improves user experience during error conditions but is not critical for basic functionality. Users can still use the app without perfect error handling.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating various error conditions (disconnect network, force 500 errors, let requests timeout) and verifying the error messages and recovery options are clear and functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the backend returns a 500 error, **When** the system retries up to 3 times and all attempts fail, **Then** a user-friendly error message appears explaining the issue and suggesting to try again
2. **Given** a request is in progress, **When** the request exceeds 12 seconds, **Then** the request is cancelled and a timeout message appears with an option to retry
3. **Given** the user cancels a request mid-flight, **When** the cancellation completes, **Then** a message indicates the request was cancelled (not an error) and allows continuing the conversation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user sends an empty message? (System should prevent sending or show validation)
- How does the system handle rapid-fire message sending before responses arrive? (Input should be disabled until response completes)
- What happens when all conversations are deleted? (System creates a new default conversation)
- How does the system handle extremely long messages? (Reasonable character limit with validation feedback)
- What happens if the backend hangs without returning a 500? (12-second timeout catches this)
- How does the system handle race conditions when switching conversations during an active request? (Cancel previous request when switching)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to type and send text messages in a chat interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST disable the input field and send button while waiting for an LLM response
- **FR-003**: System MUST display user messages and LLM responses in chronological order within a conversation
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a cancel button that aborts in-flight requests and re-enables input
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement a 12-second timeout for LLM requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST retry failed requests (HTTP 500 errors) up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **FR-007**: System MUST display user-friendly error messages for timeouts, cancellations, and failures
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a sidebar displaying all conversations with numbered titles
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to create new conversations via a button in the sidebar
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to delete conversations via a delete button next to each conversation
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to switch between conversations by clicking them in the sidebar
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist conversation history across page refreshes using browser local storage
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain independent message histories for each conversation
- **FR-014**: System MUST automatically generate numbered conversation titles (e.g., "Conversation 1", "Conversation 2")
- **FR-015**: System MUST integrate with the mock LLM backend API at the endpoint specified in the application configuration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Conversation**: Represents a chat session with a unique ID, numbered title, creation timestamp, and collection of messages
- **Message**: Represents a single chat message with content, sender type (user/assistant), timestamp, and status (sending/sent/error)
- **Request State**: Tracks the current request status including pending, success, error, cancelled, and timeout states

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can send a message and receive a response in under 15 seconds under normal conditions (excluding intentional backend delays)
- **SC-002**: Users can successfully cancel an in-flight request within 1 second of clicking cancel
- **SC-003**: System recovers from backend 500 errors with retry logic succeeding on 80% of retryable failures
- **SC-004**: Users can create, switch between, and delete conversations without data loss or UI lag
- **SC-005**: Conversation history persists across browser sessions with 100% accuracy for up to 50 conversations
- **SC-006**: Users receive clear error feedback within 2 seconds of an error condition occurring
- **SC-007**: 95% of user interactions (send, cancel, create, delete, switch) complete successfully without errors
- **SC-008**: Application handles the mock backend's 10% hang rate and 20% error rate gracefully without appearing broken

### Assumptions

- Browser supports modern JavaScript features (ES6+), local storage, and fetch API
- Users have stable internet connections (handling intermittent connectivity is out of scope)
- Maximum conversation limit is 100 conversations (after which users must delete old ones)
- Maximum message length is 4000 characters
- Messages are text-only (no images, files, or rich media)
- No streaming responses - full response arrives at once
- No user authentication - single user per browser
- No server-side persistence - all data stored in browser local storage
- No message editing or deletion - messages are immutable once sent
- Backend API follows the mock-llm server contract: POST /complete with {content: string} returns {completion: string} or {error: string}
