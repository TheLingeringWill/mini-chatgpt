# Specification Quality Checklist: Minimal ChatGPT Web Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses entirely on what users need and why, without mentioning specific technologies (Next.js, React, TypeScript are avoided). The one mention of "browser local storage" in FR-012 and assumptions is acceptable as it's a general browser capability, not a specific framework.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist. The spec made reasonable assumptions (documented in the Assumptions section) for areas like:
   - Maximum conversation limit (100)
   - Maximum message length (4000 characters)
   - Retry count (3 attempts)
   - Storage mechanism (browser local storage)

3. **Success Criteria Quality**: All 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - SC-001: Time-based (15 seconds)
   - SC-002: Time-based (1 second)
   - SC-003: Percentage-based (80%)
   - SC-004: Qualitative but testable (no data loss or lag)
   - SC-005: Accuracy and capacity (100% accuracy, 50 conversations)
   - SC-006: Time-based (2 seconds)
   - SC-007: Percentage-based (95%)
   - SC-008: Qualitative testable (gracefully handles error rates)

4. **User Scenarios**: Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) cover:
   - P1: Core chat functionality (MVP)
   - P2: Conversation management (usability enhancement)
   - P3: Error recovery (polish)

   Each story is independently testable and delivers incremental value.

5. **Edge Cases**: Six edge cases identified covering empty messages, rapid sending, conversation deletion, message length, backend hangs, and race conditions.

6. **Scope Boundaries**: Clearly defined in Assumptions section - no authentication, no server persistence, no streaming, text-only, single user, no editing/deletion of messages.

## Notes

- The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- No clarifications needed from stakeholders
- All assumptions are reasonable and documented
- The three-tier priority system enables clear MVP definition (P1 only)
